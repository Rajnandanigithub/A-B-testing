# A-B-testing
Project is about hypothesis testing 
In the context of hypothesis testing, A/B testing refers to comparing two groups (Group A: customers using credit cards and Group B: customers using cash) to evaluate differences in a specific outcome, such as average fare. It helps identify whether the payment method impacts the fare amount significantly.
Hypothesis : A statement about a population(our area of interset) which is furthers tested for posssible Rejection .
Hypothesis used in this project :
Null-Hypothesis(H0) -There is no difference in average fare between customers who use credit cards and customers who use cash.
Alternative-hypothesis(H1) - There is a difference in average fare between customers who use credit cards and customers who use cash
Level of significance -5%
How to conclude the results:
t=test is used in this , which will give p value ,if p-value <0.05 then Null hypothesis will be rejected.
